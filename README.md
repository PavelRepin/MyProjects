# MyProjects
Just some projects without any theme. TestApp is the first one Android application. It is a flight tickets receiver. 
User wants to get tickets info for a range of dates on planes. Entering city codes and date range he gets the needed info. 
The application sends the get request on a ticket API and it returns JSON. Then the info is getting parsed and shown to the user.
